<b> A 5 tile Piano app </b>
  
I wanted to go for a 88 tile at first but decided to go for 5 halfway through. I imagined creating so many tiles was pointless if they all did the same thing. And i really didn't want to make this project that big. Mostly wanted to learn about .wave and buttons from this event. It's the same idea but less code.


<b> What i learned :

1.How to add .ico , .wave files into my projects.

2.Adding buttons and using them

3.Using event handlers for buttons(Creating functions that get events from when the buttons are clicked)

4.Importance of inherting from classes, and realizing how much space importing a full class takes instead of only importing specific part i need from that class.

5.Usage of wxWidgets (Grid , Buttons, Text, Labels, 

6.Importance of optimzing my code
